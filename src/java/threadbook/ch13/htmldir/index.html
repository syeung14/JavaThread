	<td>Thread pooling holds resource usage to a predetermined, upper
		limit. Instead of starting a new thread for every request
		received by an HTTP server, a set of workers is available to 
		service requests. When this set is being completely used by 
		other requests, the server does not increase its load, but 
		rejects requests until a worker becomes available.</td>
